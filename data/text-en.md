Once when I was **six years old** I saw a *magnificent picture* in a book, called "True Stories from Nature", about the primeval forest[^5]. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal.

In the book it said: "Boa constrictors swallow their prey **whole**, without chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the *six months* that they need for digestion"[^6].

I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a **colored pencil** I succeeded in making my **first drawing**. My Drawing Number One.

[^5]: "True Stories from Nature" was a popular children's encyclopedia of that time.
[^6]: Boa constrictors can indeed digest their food for several months.
